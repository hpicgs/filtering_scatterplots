# VINCI24_ScatterplotFiltering

## Setup

As visualization framework we use D3.js together with its respective language JavaScript; for details we refer to its documentation.

The implementations with D3.js is implemented as a web page using the framework. Supplementary data is organised in a sub-folder called "data".

The server can be installed with the following command:
    npm install http-server -g
    
To view the local HTML file, start the server with the following command:
    http-server -a 127.0.0.1 -o
in your working directory containing both the sources and the data.

Then, click on the "Scatterplot.html" file to view the visualization.
